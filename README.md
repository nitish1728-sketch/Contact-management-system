## Topic: This demonstrates the contact management system with doubly linked list so that traversing can be easy.....
Our task is to implement a smarphone directory that collects contact data from the user until the user prompts the program.Contact data refers to the contact's name ,phone number.

**The user may enter as much data as he can in the mentioned data labels**

This project can demonstrate the working of contact book applications and also teach you about data structures like arrays,doubly linked lists.

Typically,**phone book management** encompasses **searching**, **deleting**, **inserting** operations

## Time complexites in O
<ul><li>Searching O(n)</li><li>Deleting O(n)</li></ul>

## Operations Implemented
**The user should enter the numbers according to which operations he want to done with phonebook**
<ul><li>Enter 1:</li><ul><li>Add a new contact</li></ul><li>Enter 2:</li><ul><li>Delete an existing contact</li></ul><li>Enter 3:</li><ul><li>Update a contact</li></ul><li>Enter 4:</li><ul><li>Search for a contact</li><ul><li>Enter 1:</li><ul><li>Search through contact name</li></ul><li>Enter 2:</li><ul><li>Search through phone number</li></ul></ul><li>Enter 5:</li><ul><li>Display all contacts</li></ul><li>Enter 6:</li><ul><li>Exit phonebook</li></ul></ul>
